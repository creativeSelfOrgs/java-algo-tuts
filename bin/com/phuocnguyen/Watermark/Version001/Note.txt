Adding a water-mark over an image 


* Step by step:

    Read the source image file into a BufferedImage object using the ImageIO.read() method.
    Obtain graphics context of the BufferedImage object.
    Using the Graphics2D object to pain the water-mark which can be a String, an image or whatever can be drawn with the Graphics2Dâ€™s API. But basically, the watermark is usually translucent so an alpha channel is needed.
    Write the output image using the ImageIO.write() method.
